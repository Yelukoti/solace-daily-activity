NAB→Network Acceleration Blade→


A Solace PubSub+ appliance relies on several interfaces and internal routing components to enable the transfer of data between the appliance and either management applications that connect to the appliance’s management interfaces or client applications that connect to the appliance's Network Acceleration Blade (NAB) interfaces. 




Step 1: Back Up Current Configuration
Before making any configuration changes, back up the current event broker configuration.


Step 2: Make Required Configuration Changes
If you switch to a NAB with less ports, the following configuration changes are required:
LAG Configuration
Bridge Configuration
Replication Configuration
Message Backbone VRF Configuration
IP Interface Configuration
Routing Interface Configuration


Step 3: Reload Event Broker Configuration
After making the necessary configuration changes, reload the event broker configuration:


Step 4: Backup Event Broker Configuration


Step 5: Power Down Appliance


Step 6: Physically Change Out NAB

->Group the NAB ports into one or more LAGs. The number of LAGs possible for the network interfaces is limited by the number of Ethernet ports present (due to the fact that LAGs reuse MAC addresses allocated for Ethernet ports).
->Assign independent IP addresses to each NAB port (that is, no LAG configured).
->A mixture of both, that is, have some of the Ethernet ports grouped into a single LAG, and the remaining ports independently addressed.
